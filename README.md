## What we expect from you

The frontend task involves building up the base angular app to match the mobile designs included in the repo. [DONE]
The solution should take into account: 

- This is a mobile design which would be accessed by various devises/browsers. [DONE]

- The contents of the basket will be retained between browser reloads. [DONE]

- It should be as true to the designs as possible, but candidates should feel free to add anything that improves the flow/design. [OK]

- A solution should show an understanding of the problems involved and make use of the tech stack to solve them. [OK]

## Observations (not excuses)

I tried to do the best with the time I had. I recon that:

- Animations could be better with more time.

- In the header I think the scrolling should be better on the whole list instead of just the main and the others content as in the design.

- Stopping the scrolling on the menu when basket is open can be improved.
